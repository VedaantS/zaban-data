### Transliteration of the alphabet

Transliteration is the act of switching scripts; it will allow you to read the sound form of the text written in the alphabet that you do not understand (e.g. a Hindi speaker who does not know the English alphabet cannot read *I like cars* correctly, but they can understand the pronounciation of *आई लाइक कार्स*, which is a transliteration into the Hindi alphabet, and will be able to read it, even if they can't understand it.)
